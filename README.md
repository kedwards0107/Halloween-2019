# Halloween-2019
Raspberry Pi 3 - Candy tracker 

This was a halloween project I did with my son to track what was the most popular candy of the 4 he selected; KitKats, Sour Patch Kids, Twix or Nerds. We used a breadboard attached to a raspberry pi 3, a 8 terminal switch, led light strings for the "arrows" and 5 arcade buttons. The lights for the arcade buttons ran off of a 9 volt battery. When you pressed the button it activated the switch attached to that particular candy's "arrow" and also updated a google sheets chart which was shown on an ipad in the cabinet.
